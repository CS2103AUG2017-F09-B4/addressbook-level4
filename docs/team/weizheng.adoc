=== Enhancement Added: Command Box Helper

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: User Guide]]#

* When you start typing in the command line, a helper box appears to show you the list of commands available.
* e.g Typing `e` in the command line will show both the `edit` and `exit` commands in the command helper box.
* You can use the arrow keys to select commands that are displayed and press enter or tab to make it autofill for you in the command line.
