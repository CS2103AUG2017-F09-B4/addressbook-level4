== Project: OurAb
OurAb is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 6 kLoC.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/tree/master/src/main[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/tree/master/src/test[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Command Box Helper

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [[from:] https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc [User Guide]]#

* When you start typing in the command line, a helper box appears to show you the list of commands available.
* e.g Typing `e` in the command line will show both the `edit` and `exit` commands in the command helper box.

_Figure 2.2.1 : Structure of the UI Component_

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.
