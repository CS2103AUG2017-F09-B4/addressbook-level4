== Project: OurAb
OurAb is a CLI(Command Line Interface)-based desktop Address Book application written in Java, targeted at university students.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/collated/main/liuhang0213.md[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/collated/test/liuhang0213.md[Test code]]

=== Profile Photo

A profile photo is displayed for each person in the addressbook.

==== Implementation

During initialization, the application uses a person's email address to download his/her profile photo from link:https://en.gravatar.com/site/implement/[Gravatar] to `cache/`. The photo will then be displayed on the person card.
When a new person is added or a person's email address is changed, the new profile photo will be downloaded. +
For persons who have not set a Gravatar photo before, user also has the option to choose what type of default photo to
display.

==== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** source of the profile photos +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Gravatar +
**Pros:** easy to implement; does not require user to input extra information +
**Cons:** less customizable +
**Alternative 2:** from other social network websites (Instagram, Facebook, etc.) +
**Pros:** OurAB's target demographics usually update their profile photos on SNS more frequently +
**Cons:** authentication might be required; User need to input contacts' user id for different websites +
**Alternative 3:** user uploads profile photo for each person +
**Pros:** user has most freedom to customize their addressbook +
**Cons:** upload photo would be too complicated for a CLI application +

**Aspect:** download photos in foreground or background +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** only download in background when the `DefaultProfilePhoto` preference is changed +
**Pros:** the solution is balanced between program response time and update time (see below for explanation on the trade-off) +
**Cons:** user might not see the change immediately after changing the preference +
**Alternative 2:** always download in foreground +
**Pros:** profile photos will be updated as soon as they are available +
**Cons:** the application will freeze during the download; if `DefaultProfilePhoto` preference is changed, the application will appear unresponsive +
**Alternative 3:** always download in background +
**Pros:** user will not notice any unresponsiveness when using the application +
**Cons:** it is technically challenging to update the photo in UI timely (concurrency is difficult)

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

To allow users to view the next meeting conveniently.

=== Enhancement Added: Meetings Storage

==== External behavior

* Provides storage for meetings management, which will be implemented in future versions (> v1.3).

==== Justification

To provide functionality for storing meeting data

---

==== Implementation

=== Enhancement Added: User Preferences Management

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#preferences[from: Developer Guide]]#

In addition to configuration, user can customize the address book application by editing preferences. The difference between
configurations and preferences is that configuration stores basic information requried to start the application, while
preferences determine high level functionalities and UI styles.

#End of Extract#

User can change the value of a preference by entering `pref PREFERENCE_KEY NEW_PREFERENCE_VALUE`.

If no new value is entered, the current value for the preference will be displayed.

==== Justification

To allow users to customize the address book application conveniently.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc#361-implementation[from: Developer Guide]]#

When a `pref` command is entered, the `PrefCommand` will attempt to find and execute `get<PreferenceKey>`
method in the `UserPrefs` class using Java Reflection API. If an exception is encountered, it is assumed that the method
does not exist and the preference key entered by the user was invalid. Similarly, if two arguments were entered, `PrefCommand`
will again try to find and execute `set<PreferenceKey>` method.

=== Enhancement Added: Backup and restoring data

==== External behavior

* Provides functionality for saving a backup copy of the address book in different folder.

---

==== Justification

To ensure safety of data in case of runtime exceptions or crashes
