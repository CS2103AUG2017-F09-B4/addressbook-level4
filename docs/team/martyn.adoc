== Project: OurAb
OurAb is a CLI(Command Line Interface)-based desktop Address Book application written in Java, targeted at university students.

*Code contributed*: [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/tree/master/src/main[Functional code]] [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/tree/master/src/test[Test code]]

=== Enhancement Added: Shortcut Command

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: User Guide]]#

Users can type a shortcut command for 16 commands, where entering the first letter(s) of the command also returns the same functionality:
1) Add
2) Delete
3) Edit
4) Find
5) History
6) List
7) Redo
8) Select
9) Undo
10) AddMeeting
11) DeleteTag
12) ListByMostSearched
13) Pref
14) NextMeeting
15) Map
16) Search

e.g. entering "l" will also return a list of persons in the address book

==== Justification

To make it more convenient for experienced users, who will be able to use the address book more efficiently once they are familiar with
the shortcuts. Users can refer to the user guide for the list of the command shortcuts.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

Alternatively to COMMAND_WORD, commands also have COMMAND_ALIAS which AddressBookParser will also accept as a valid input to execute the
desired command

[source,java]
----
     public static final String COMMAND_WORD = "add";
     public static final String COMMAND_ALIAS = "a";
----

[source,java]
----
        case AddCommand.COMMAND_WORD:
        case AddCommand.COMMAND_ALIAS:
            return new AddCommandParser().parse(arguments);
----

=== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Shortcut implementation +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Use an alias, shortened form of the command +
**Pros:** Intuitive and easier to remember +
**Cons:** Might have overlapping aliases, requiring updates +
**Alternative 2:** Use a index for shortcuts +
**Pros:** Easier to map each command +
**Cons:** Less intuitive, and harder to remember

=== Enhancement Added: Search Command

=== External Behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: 2.4. Listing all persons, sorted by search frequency : listByMostSearched]]#

* Users can search for contacts using the Search command and keywords. The search method will check all parameters of the user.

From this example, it can be understood that by searching Serangoon, we can see that it has listed all the people living in Serangoon, namely 'Bernice' and 'David'

==== Justification

Allows users to have a more powerful search function, which will become more useful when the address book increases in size.

---

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

The keywords are generated as list of strings, which is then checked against the details of the persons
in address book.

The details are returned as strings, by the ReadOnlyPerson method in the person model. The list of searched
people is then continually updated, before it is finally returned to the user

=== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** implementation of `Search` command over `Find`  +
**Pros:** More powerful search tool +
**Cons:** Unnecessary results may be returned for larger address books
