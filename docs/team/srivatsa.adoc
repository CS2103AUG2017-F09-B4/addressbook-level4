=== Enhancement Added: List by most searched command

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: 2.4. Listing all persons, sorted by search frequency : listByMostSearched]]#

* When `ListByMostSearched` command is executed, a list of persons is displayed based on how frequently each person is +
searched for.

From this example, it can be understood that `Alex Yeoh` is the most searched person, followed by `David Li` etc.

==== Justification

Allows users to list contacts based on people they often connect with.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

Each successful `Find` command execution, activates an update of search count for everyone in search results.+
This equates to an update of the search count variable within the `SearchData` class within every `Person` class.

When the `ListByMostSearched` is executed, `UniquePersonList` is sorted based on descending search count. +
This updates the address book storage file. When model calls for `filteredPersons` list, all persons are read from +
the address book storage and then displayed on `PersonListPanel` on the GUI.

Discarded Alternative(s):

** Implement a separate storage for search data, to minimise changes to addressbook storage.
[none]
*** *Reason against:* A lot of unnecessary repetitions in code
** Create a temporary list that sorts and displays persons, instead of modifying the addressbook.
[none]
*** *Reason against:* It is better to permanently change the addressbook, to optimise 'find' command & +
build foundation for a potential `favourites` list;

=== Enhancement Proposed: Find LinkedIn Contact

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: User Guide]]#

* When any of the contacts in the addressbook is selected, their LinkedIn Profile is displayed.
* e.g When `Alex Yeoh` is selected in the panel the display to the right will show his Linkedin profile.
