=== Enhancement Added: List by most searched command

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: 2.4. Listing all persons, sorted by search frequency : listByMostSearched]]#

* When `ListByMostSearched` command is executed, a list of persons is displayed based on how frequently each person is +
searched for.

+

From this example, it can be understood that `Alex Yeoh` is the most searched person, followed by `David Li` etc.

==== Justification

Allows users to list contacts based on people they often connect with.

==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/DeveloperGuide.adoc[from: Developer Guide]]#

Each successful `Find` command execution with non-zero search results, activates an update of search count for everyone in search results.+
[source,java]
----
if (searchResultsCount != NO_RESULTS) {
    model.recordSearchHistory();
}

----
This equates to an update of the search count variable within the `SearchData` class within every `Person` class.
[source,java]
----
public void incrementSearchCount()
----

When the `ListByMostSearched` is executed, `UniquePersonList` is sorted based on descending search count. +
[source,java]
----
public void sortBySearchCount () {
    internalList.sort(new ReadOnlyPersonComparator());
}
----
The `ReadOnlyPersonComparator` compares the search count between two Persons. This updates the address book storage file.+
When model calls for `filteredPersons` list, all persons are read from +
the address book storage and then displayed on `PersonListPanel` on the GUI.

=== Design Considerations

**Aspect:** Implementation of storage for `SearchData` +
**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add `SearchData` as a class in `Person` +
**Pros:** Increase storage efficiency +
**Cons:** `Addressbook.xml` is more complicated
**Alternative 2:** Add `SearchData` to a separate storage file +
**Pros:** Minimal changes to `Addressbook.xml` +
**Cons:** Unnecessary repetition in storage; replication of `Person` details +

---

**Aspect:** Persistent sort +
**Alternative 1(current choice):** Persistent sort (Sort persons, by modifying `addressbook.xml`) +
**Pros:** Reduces need for repeated sorting & speed up `find` command +
**Cons:** Unnecessary operations on storage `addressbook.xml` +
**Alternative 2:** Non-persistent sort (Sort persons in a temporary list) +
**Pros:** Reduce operations on storage file, `Addressbook.xml` +
**Cons:** Use of additional storage to copy all contacts is inefficient in terms of time & storage

=== Enhancement Proposed: Find LinkedIn Contact

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-F09-B4/main/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc[from: User Guide]]#

* When any of the contacts in the addressbook is selected, their LinkedIn Profile is displayed.
* e.g When `Alex Yeoh` is selected in the panel the display to the right will show his Linkedin profile.
